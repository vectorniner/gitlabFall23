In the center of the room stood a clock tower, its hands frozen in time. The ground around it was littered with lifeless bodies, a grim testament to the power of the entity I was facing. Despite its benign appearance, the clock tower proved to be a formidable adversary. After a fierce battle that tested my limits, I managed to cleanse the clock tower using a ritual. The ritual, a series of complex movements and incantations, seemed to resonate with the energy of the room, drawing out the dark energy from the clock tower. However, the room remained altered, a stark reminder of the battle that had taken place.\n"

Peering through the glass of the control room, I was shocked to find my long-lost brother. But he was not the same - his eyes were vacant, his mind corrupted by the hiss. His once familiar features were now foreign, twisted by the dark influence of the hiss.
