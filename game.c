It seemed to pulsate with energy, and I could hear what sounded like the Boardâ€™s voices emanating from within. Suddenly, everything around me shattered like glass, transforming into a red void. I felt myself falling into the unknown. Just when I thought I would be lost forever, I found myself standing before the Board, my brother standing in front of me.\nMy brother, once my closest ally, was now a stranger. The hiss had corrupted him, twisted his mind until he saw me as an enemy. I knew I had to stop him, but the thought of fighting my own brother was unbearable. The room around us shifted, walls moving and reshaping, forming a pyramid pointing towards the projector - the source of all this chaos."

             "\nHe was yelling, \"I hate you\", over and over again. Each word was a dagger to my heart. I loved him, had always protected him, and now he was lost to me. I dodged his attacks, refusing to fight back. Then, a gunshot echoed through the room. I cleansed the projector, stopping the hiss from entering any further. The red faded away, and my brother collapsed to the ground."

             "\nBut instead of ending it all, I found myself walking back to the directorâ€™s office. It was where I belonged. It was a place that had shaped me, changed me, made me who I am. The loss of my brother taught me valuable lessons about power, responsibility, and sacrifice. I knew what I had to do next, what changes I needed to make. I didn't feel like going back. I was operating on the shifting logic of a dream, ready to face whatever came next."
             "\nThis was my story, a tale of love, loss, and sacrifice in the face of an unimaginable threat. It was a journey that took me from the mundane to the extraordinary, from the familiar to the unknown. It was a story of courage and determination, of facing fears and overcoming obstacles. It was a story of a bond between siblings, tested and strained, yet unbroken in spirit."
             "\nIn this story, I was not just a bystander, but an active participant. I was the one who stepped through the Aether Door, who faced the hiss, who navigated the shifting walls of the astral plane. I was the one who fought, who struggled, who persevered. I was the one who loved, who lost, and who ultimately made the ultimate sacrifice."
             "\nBut this was not just my story. It was also the story of my brother, of the Board, of the hiss. It was the story of the astral plane, of the shifting walls and the upside-down pyramid. It was the story of every object of power, every corrupted entity, every challenge I faced."
             "\nAnd though my story may have ended, the memories remain. The love for my brother, the battles fought, the mysteries unraveled - they are all a part of me now. They have shaped me, changed me, made me who I am. And for that, I am grateful."
             "\nSo, this was my story. But in many ways, it is also just the beginning. Because every end is a new beginning, every closing door opens a new one, and every story told gives birth to a new one. And so, even as my story ends, a new one begins.";
